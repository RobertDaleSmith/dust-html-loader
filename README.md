# [dust](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs) loader for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

Compiles dust templates with partials and exports the compiled HTML, allowing for rendering of the templates from [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin) in [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) environment.

## Thanks 🙏♥️
