# [dust](https://github.com/linkedin/dustjs) to html loader for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

Compiles dust templates with partials and exports the compiled HTML, allowing for rendering of the templates to static html files with [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin).

Built for use with the [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) testing environment in mind.

## Usage
```
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
    filename: 'index.html',
    template: '!!dust-html-loader?root='+path.join(__dirname,'src/views')+'!src/views/index.dust'
  }),
]
```
